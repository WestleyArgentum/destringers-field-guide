# Transporting and Housing Pigeons


## Emergency Transport

A paper bag or box can make a very effective (and accessible) emergency bird transport. Make sure they get enough air.


## Temporary Caging

Provide the best housing you can, but try to give the pigeon a personal space of at least 1ft / 30cm square.

If you are unsure about the birds medical state (if you worry they might be sick or emaciated), it is usually best to withhold food and water. If a pigeon is already starving they might not have enough energy to actually break food down and convert it into energy, and they might die trying. Get them help as soon as possible.


## Open Questions

- When moving a pigeon in a paper bag, should you consider putting the pigeon in a sock so that they definitely cannot escape? Or is the risk that they would get hurt (can't keep balance while bound and might get beak or feet stuck in sock) too great?
