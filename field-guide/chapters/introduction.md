# Introduction


## Manifesto

- We are driving mass extinction
- There can be great value in observing things happening in the world without actively interfering. Life is violent, and by this violence systems of tremendous complexity and resilience have come about.
- But it is also important to recognize that there is no way to not interfere. If you are reading these words you are part of the cycle and your existence has consequences both in the immediate and distant future.
- Knowledge about how to engage with the other creatures we share this planet with should not be gated off. Humans that don't care will still kill other creatures. We should be trying to share knowledge about interacting with other creatures as wide as possible.

## Overview of Destringing


## Goals of This Field Guide

This guide should:

- Present destringing as an ethical, practical example of inter-species communication and engagement
- Contain all the information needed to take a human from no knowledge of pigeons to destringing them ethically
- Help achieve better results for pigeons by prompting you with the answers to questions you might otherwise (completely understandably) ask too late
- Be easily printable and distributable so that destringers can simply and effectively connect other interested humans to the knowledge they need


## Further Learning

Many wonderful resources about destringing and helping pigeons exist out there. Read, watch, and listen widely!

### Look for Other Humans in your Area

If you like working with other humans, remember that it's possible there are others in your area who also try to destring or otherwise help pigeons. Coordinating with them could have advantages both during the process of destringing (extra hands makes some difficult situations easier) and, more generally, in coordination of food distribution.

- Look across social media. Destringing groups in different cities sometimes have facebook pages.
- Consider organizing a group
