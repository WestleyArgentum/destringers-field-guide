# Printing the Destringers' Field Guide

### Paper weight and type:

- If using an inkjet printer, you will need a relatively heavy paper so that you print to both sides without it becoming too warped. For the initial run I used double sided matte brochure paper that was 35lbs / 130gsm.
- If you are using a laser printer this should matter less, but thicker paper would still probably give the best results.
- I went with matte paper so that the booklets could be handled extensively without acquiring too many fingerprints, etc.
- Make sure to select the correct color profile for the type of paper you inserted. Try a few if you are unsure.


### Paper size and formatting:

- The pages are each formatted to perfectly fill an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper (standard in the US)
- This means that when printing, for best results, turn on "borderless" or "edge-to-edge" printing and select an 8.5 x 11 inch paper size
- The pdfs in the bundle each represent one side of a piece of paper. So "01_32-1.pdf" is the first side of the first piece of paper (01) and becomes the back cover (32) and the front cover (1). "02_2-31.pdf" is the backside of the first piece of paper (02) and becomes pages 2 and 31. Etc.
- If your printer can print double sided, you will need to tell it to "flip on the short edge" of the paper. If you are rotating the paper by hand, pick up the paper and spin it top-to-bottom when reinserting in the tray, so that the paper has rotated around a horizontal axis.
- Do some test prints before committing to a large batch!

### General tips:
- Once you are sure you have a workflow it can help to print in batches (print X of the first page, flip them around, print X of the second page, etc).
- Use a "bone folder", or something smooth and hard, when folding the pages. Pre folding them before stacking them together works much better.
- After pre-folding and stacking the pages into a booklet, use a few binder clips to hold the stack together while stapling down the middle.
- That's all I've got â€“ if you know more about printing and binding and think something here could be improved, feel free to reach out to distrustful.dinosaurs@gmail.com, thanks!
