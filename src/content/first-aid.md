# First Aid

## Deciding Whether to Intervene

- If a pigeon's head is drooping / upside down, if they are moving very unsteadily, or if they are on the ground and not moving much at all, they probably need immediate medical attention and stand a low chance of survival if left alone. They could have an often deadly disease called PMV, head trauma, they could be poisoned, etc.
- If you see a pigeon with a visibly broken wing or leg they are probably experiencing extreme pain and stress and need a safe space and medical attention as soon as possible.
- If a baby pigeon is outside of the nest and unable to fly the parents will not be able to take care of them and they won't survive. If you find a baby pigeon (and you are sure it is a baby pigeon) then you should try to return it to its nest. If you cannot find the nest, or all parents / guardians are gone for longer than an hour, you should step in and rescue the baby.


## Situations

### Help a Sick / Injured / Baby Pigeon

It is difficult to give succinct, universal advice on treating any sickness or injury that a pigeon may be facing. But by following the steps below you will give them the best chance you can:  

- Secure them so that they do not retreat somewhere where they cannot be helped.
- Warm them up by wrapping them gently in a towel and/or providing them some kind of heat source like a towel-wrapped hot water bottle or heat lamp (this is especially important for baby pigeons).
- Isolate them, or do what you can to give them a quiet, dark space in which to warm up and calm down.
- If you know where they can get immediate medical care, take them there. Otherwise, take photos of them and their most recent droppings (or any solids/fluids they may be producing) and quickly post them along with a short description and your location to: https://www.pigeons.biz/forums/emergency-resources-assistance.113
- If you know by circumstances that a pigeon is emaciated and/or dehydrated, and they have been warmed up and are alert and responsive, you can try to rehydrate them. Mix a pinch of salt and sugar into a cup of room-temperature or slightly warmed water, stir until dissolved, then use an eyedropper or similar to slowly administer a few drops along the edge of their beak every few minutes.

Note: All of the above is simplified advice printed just in case â€“ if you have access to the internet you can read better more detailed information here: https://www.pigeons.biz/threads/basic-steps-to-saving-the-life-of-a-pigeon-or-dove.11265

### Stop Bleeding Fast

- Quickly clean the area using veterinary wound spray.
- Apply styptic powder or turmeric (Cornstarch or Flour will also work) to the area by dusting it on or using a cotton swab. The powder will cause the blood to coagulate and hopefully help prevent infection.
- Use cotton gauze or pads and apply moderate pressure to the wound until bleeding stops completely.

## Open Questions

- In cases where there was some bleeding, is it reasonable to stop the bleeding and set them free with a bit of antibiotic cream rubbed onto their feet?
- How does one recognize when bleeding is bad enough that the pigeon needs to be separated from the flock?
