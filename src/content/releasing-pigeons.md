# Releasing Pigeons After Destringing

- If possible, bring the pigeon's flock over by scattering some grain.
- Before releasing a pigeon, always look around carefully. Wait for any form of danger to pass.
- Always let pigeons free with their feet on the ground. They may be disoriented and/or may simply choose to walk away rather than fly.
