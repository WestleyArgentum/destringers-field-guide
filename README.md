</h1>

## Overview

Use this guide to lean to help "stringfoot" pigeons that you encounter.

Its goals are to:

- Present destringing as an ethical, practical example of inter-species communication, engagement, and aid.
- Contain all the information needed to take a human from no knowledge of pigeons to destringing them responsibly.
- Help achieve better results for pigeons by prompting you with the answers to questions you might otherwise (completely understandably) ask too late.
- Be easily distributable so that destringers can simply and effectively connect other interested humans to the knowledge they need.
- Evolve over time so that it represents the best possible advice.
