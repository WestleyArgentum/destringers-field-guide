If you find a baby pigeon (and you are sure it is a baby pigeon) then you should try to return it to its nest. If you cannot find the nest, or all parents / guardians are gone for longer than an hour, you should step in and rescue the baby.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"situations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#situations\" aria-label=\"situations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Situations</h2>\n<h3 id=\"help-a-sick--injured--baby-pigeon\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#help-a-sick--injured--baby-pigeon\" aria-label=\"help a sick  injured  baby pigeon permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Help a Sick / Injured / Baby Pigeon</h3>\n<p>It is difficult to give succinct, universal advice on treating any sickness or injury that a pigeon may be facing. But by following the steps below you will give them the best chance you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure them so that they do not retreat somewhere where they cannot be helped.</li>\n<li>Warm them up by wrapping them gently in a towel and/or providing them some kind of heat source like a towel-wrapped hot water bottle or heat lamp (this is especially important for baby pigeons).</li>\n<li>Isolate them, or do what you can to give them a quiet, dark space in which to warm up and calm down.</li>\n<li>If you know where they can get immediate medical care, take them there. Otherwise, take photos of them and their most recent droppings (or any solids/fluids they may be producing) and quickly post them along with a short description and your location to: <a href=\"https://www.pigeons.biz/forums/emergency-resources-assistance.113\">https://www.pigeons.biz/forums/emergency-resources-assistance.113</a></li>\n<li>If you know by circumstances that a pigeon is emaciated and/or dehydrated, and they have been warmed up and are alert and responsive, you can try to rehydrate them. Mix a pinch of salt and sugar into a cup of room-temperature or slightly warmed water, stir until dissolved, then use an eyedropper or similar to slowly administer a few drops along the edge of their beak every few minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: All of the above is simplified advice printed just in case â€“ if you have access to the internet you can read better more detailed information here: <a href=\"https://www.pigeons.biz/threads/basic-steps-to-saving-the-life-of-a-pigeon-or-dove.11265\">https://www.pigeons.biz/threads/basic-steps-to-saving-the-life-of-a-pigeon-or-dove.11265</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"stop-bleeding-fast\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#stop-bleeding-fast\" aria-label=\"stop bleeding fast permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stop Bleeding Fast</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply styptic powder (Cornstarch or Flour will also work) to the wound by dusting it on or using a cotton swab. The powder will cause the blood to coagulate and hopefully stop the bleeding.</li>\n<li>You can also apply a little pressure by holding a clean cloth or pad against the wound.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"medical-facilities\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#medical-facilities\" aria-label=\"medical facilities permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Medical Facilities</h2>\n<p>Search now and use this space to write down all relevant contact info (names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc) for medical facilities that can help with injured pigeons in your area.
