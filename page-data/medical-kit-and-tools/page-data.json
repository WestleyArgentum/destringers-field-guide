Critical in emergencies, don't forget it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Large Socks / Small Towels:\n<ul>\n<li>Nobody likes to be captured by a giant and operated on. Wrapping the bird in something can help calm them.</li>\n<li>Large socks with the toe cut off can be very effective. Make sure the fabric inside the sock is smooth and does not have threads or loops that a pigeon could get their beak or toenails caught in. Most important, make sure the sock is large and does not constrict the pigeon. Pigeons use their whole bodies to breath, they need to be able to expand their chest.</li>\n<li>Small towels can also be effective, and might be easier to take off without ruffling too many feathers. Again, make sure not to wrap them too tight, let the pigeon breath.</li>\n<li>Do not reuse socks/towels multiple times before washing. You risk transferring diseases between birds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alcohol Wipes:\n<ul>\n<li>For disinfecting tools between uses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hand Sanitizer:\n<ul>\n<li>There is very little risk of you catching any diseases. But cleaning your hands between operations can be nice and helps prevent the spread of diseases between birds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Small Bags:\n<ul>\n<li>Use two bags to separate clean and dirty socks.</li>\n<li>Use another bag to keep string, gunk, and the occasional necrotic tissue that you remove, for safe disposal later.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Large Paper Bag(s) / Foldable Animal Carrier:\n<ul>\n<li>Be prepared to find pigeons who need more help than you can administer in the field. A paper bag or animal carrier can serve as a great emergency transport.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"optional-helpful\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#optional-helpful\" aria-label=\"optional helpful permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Optional, Helpful</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Small Workstation Towel:\n<ul>\n<li>Laying your tools out on a towel before you begin helps keep them clean and accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Additional Manicure Set Tools:\n<ul>\n<li>Thicker scissors, nail files, etc can be helpful when dealing with things like toenails that have grown around in a circle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Warm Water With Bath Salts (in a Thermos):\n<ul>\n<li>A warm foot bath can do wonders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Triple Antibiotic Cream (without \"pain reliever\" additives):\n<ul>\n<li>Antibiotics are a controversial topic. Human overuse of antibiotics is, arguably, extremely dangerous. Depending on where you live you may or may not be allowed to purchase them. Do some research and decide what you think.</li>\n<li>Oil based ointments generally should not be used (oil and feathers do not mix), but antibiotic creams (water based) are safe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cotten Swabs:\n<ul>\n<li>Useful for applying styptic powder, antibiotics, etc, into crevices cut by string.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Headlamp:\n<ul>\n<li>A small light can be very useful on days / places with less-than-ideal illumination.</li>\n<li>Make sure not to shine bright led lights into a pigeon's eyes – keep their head tucked in a sock or towel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Magnification Device:\n<ul>\n<li>It's important to remove all hair/thread/etc – a single strand left can still cut off circulation, cause infection, etc. A magnification lens can help you feel confident that you've removed everything.</li>\n<li>Jewellers often use \"headband\" or \"visor\" magnifiers that you can use hands-free. Some even have built-in lights.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Camping Stool:\n<ul>\n<li>Kneeling for long periods of time can strain your body. The more relaxed you are the easier it will be to do right by the pigeons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/medical-kit-and-tools/"}},
